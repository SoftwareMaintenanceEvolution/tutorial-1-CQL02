Hi! I'm **Chung Qi Lin**, a student in the Software Maintenance and Evolution course.

I'm looking forward to learning more about effective strategies for software maintenance and gaining a deeper understanding of how to deal with legacy systems.

- **Fun fact**: I eat when I'm hungry ðŸ™‚.
- **Course expectations**: To acquire practical skills in maintaining and enhancing software systems, especially in real-world scenarios.
